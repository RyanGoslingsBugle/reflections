When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to work from more than one location, collaborate with people who aren't in the same physical location, or share work with unknown folks.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Perhaps you're working on a new feature, and you want to prototype locally without git overwriting your commits with the static version from GitHub.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks: Your own version of a GitHub repo opened by someone else. Refers to but doesn't modify. 
For working with other people's projects you want to do something different with that they're not interested in merging right now.
Clone: Exactly the same repo downloaded to another place. Maintains a link to origin repo.
For keeping local copies of a repo to work on.
Branch: Another series of commits included in the repo, which might contain different commits to the master.
For making changes you don't want to include in the main branch right now.
