When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to work from more than one location, collaborate with people who aren't in the same physical location, or share work with unknown folks.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Perhaps you're working on a new feature, and you want to prototype locally without git overwriting your commits with the static version from GitHub.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks: Your own version of a GitHub repo opened by someone else. Refers to but doesn't modify. 
For working with other people's projects you want to do something different with that they're not interested in merging right now.
Clone: Exactly the same repo downloaded to another place. Maintains a link to origin repo.
For keeping local copies of a repo to work on.
Branch: Another series of commits included in the repo, which might contain different commits to the master.
For making changes you don't want to include in the main branch right now.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can run operations against the last-known state of the origin repo even while offline. Also, it gives you a logical path to merge with subsequent commits.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

With Git, you'd have to clone a repo then try to merge every change, which would be a nightmare. With Hub, you can review pull requests for conflicts before merging the code.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Well, usually the master branch is supposed to be a working version, so if you're making risky (any) changes, you should use a dev branch.
That's going to mean more merge work though, so if you're just updating docs, you're probably fine.
