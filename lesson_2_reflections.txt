What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git adds all the necessary scaffolding to track commits - if you don't do that, nothing will be tracked, dummy

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It doesn't represent a location on disk, more a collection of files that are held together, like a repo. But, they aren't yet bound together strongly.
It's a nice way of choosing what does and doesn't make it into the commit.
